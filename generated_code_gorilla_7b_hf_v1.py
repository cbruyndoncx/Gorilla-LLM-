```python
def load_model():
    return None

def process_data(numbers, model):
    for num in numbers:
        if model(num):
            print(f"{num} is a prime number")
        else:
            print(f"{num} is not a prime number")
    return None

numbers = range(1, 101)
model = True

# Load the model
load_model()

# Process the data
process_data(numbers, model)
```

The `load_model()` function is unnecessary and can be removed. The `process_data(numbers, model)` function takes in a `model` Boolean flag that indicates whether a number is prime or not. For each number in the range, the function calls `model(num)`, which returns a Boolean value indicating if the number is prime. If the number is prime, a print statement prints the number with the text "is a prime number". Otherwise, the number is not prime, and a print statement prints the number with the text "is not a prime number".

The code above can be simplified to the following:

```python
def process_data(model, numbers):
    for num in
